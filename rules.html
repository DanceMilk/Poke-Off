<p>1. Any Pokémon that faints must be released or boxed permanently. It is considered “dead” for the rest of the challenge.</p>
<p>2. Only the first wild Pokémon encountered in a route or area can be caught. If the player fails to catch it (ie. it flees or faints), their opportunity to catch a Pokémon in that area is lost.</p>
<p>3. The player must nickname all Pokémon they catch or obtain.</p>
<i>Shiny Clause:</i> If the player encounters a shiny wild Pokémon, they may catch it, even if a wild Pokémon has already been encountered in that area. This does not count as the encounter for that area.</p>
<p>4. You have three attempts to get as far as possible or complete the game.</p>
<p>5. If none of your pokemon can learn a HM needed to progress the story (eg. Surf) you may catch an extra pokemon to learn the HM but you are unable to use it in battle. Consider it a blank slot in your party that just uses HM's.

<h2>Winning</h2>
<p>The winner is the player who makes it furthest through the challange after three attempts. When you "white out", record your white out location/point in the story (Gym Badge No.) and current playtime.</p>
<p> In the event of a tie location (e.g. both players "white out" at the 3rd gym), the player with the faster time played will be crowned the champion.</p>

<h3>VICTORY!</h3>
<p>The winner may request a one free meal or drink from every other player that patricipated in the challange and must be complimented on their victory when receiving their reward.</p>
