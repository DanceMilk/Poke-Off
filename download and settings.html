<h2>Settings Used</h2>

<p>Pretty much everything is random. Wild pokemon, Trainer pokemon, Items (though no junk items can be found e.g. berries etc).</p> 
<p>Gym and trainers will still be type themed, but the type will be random. For example the what is normally the fire gym could now be full of poison type pokemon instead.</p>
<p>Wild pokemon uses Area Mapping 1-1. (see left image for explanation).</p>
<p>HM's are as normal. If you become stuck due to none of your pokemon being able to learn a HM required to progress the story, you may catch an additional pokemon to remedy the situation.See <a href="rules.html">Rules Section</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Happy Poke-ing</p>
